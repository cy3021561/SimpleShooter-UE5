## Overview

Simple FPS Shooter is an exciting course project developed for the Udemy course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games." The project focuses on creating a basic First-Person Shooter (FPS) game using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and C++ programming. By implementing fundamental gameplay mechanics, animations, and enemy AI, Simple FPS Shooter provides an interactive and educational experience for aspiring game developers.

## Project Plan

1. **Player Movement:** The project starts with implementing smooth and responsive player movement in the first-person perspective. Participants will learn how to control the player character using basic keyboard inputs.

2. **Animation:** Participants will be guided through the process of adding animations to the player character. This includes animations for walking, running, and other movements.

3. **Shooting:** The course covers the development of shooting mechanics for the player character. Participants will learn how to handle inputs to fire projectiles and interact with the game environment.

4. **Health/Death:** Students will implement health and damage systems for the player character. Upon reaching zero health, the player character will face defeat with appropriate visual feedback.

5. **Enemy AI:** The project introduces enemy AI, allowing participants to create challenging opponents for the player. Participants will learn how to program basic enemy behaviors and interactions.

6. **Winning/Losing Conditions:** The course concludes by implementing winning and losing conditions for the game. Players will be able to achieve victory or face defeat based on specific in-game criteria.
